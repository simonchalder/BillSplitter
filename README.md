Currently the application allows the user to:

- Split a decimal number between multiple people (from 2 to 6 currently)
- Choose a tip amount from 10% to 20%
- Calculate the amount owed by each person, their share of the tip and the overall total for each person

To-do:

 - Unit testing (will do some for practice but this is a simple app)
 - Add more exception handling if required
 - Add more options for numbers of persons
 - Look into Trip Advisor API and possibly add functionaility to leave review through the app
 - UI changes to improve looks and usability
