Developer: Simon Chalder

A graphical desktop application to calculate the share of a bill bewtween multiple persons.

Currently the application allows the user to:

- Split a decimal number between multiple people (from 2 to 10 currently)
- Choose a tip amount from 10% to 20%
- Calculate the amount owed by each person, their share of the tip and the overall total for each person

To-do:

 - Unit testing (will do some for practice but this is a simple app)
 - Add more exception handling if required (input validation now included)
 - Add more options for numbers of persons (updated to 10)
 - Look into Trip Advisor API and possibly add functionaility to leave review through the app - not possible as Trip Advisor will only give API key to established travel     and food websites or apps.
 - UI changes to improve looks and usability
